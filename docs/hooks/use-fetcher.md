# `useFetcher`

In HTML/HTTP, data mutations and loads are modeled with navigation: `<a href>` and `<form action>`. Both cause a navigation in the browser. The React Router equivalents are [`<Link>`][link] and [`<Form>`][form].

But sometimes you want to call a [`loader`][loader] outside of navigation, or call an [`action`][action] (and get the data on the page to revalidate) without changing the URL. Or you need to have multiple mutations in-flight at the same time.

Many interactions with the server aren't navigation events. This hook lets you plug your UI into your actions and loaders without navigating.

<docs-warning>This feature only works if using a data router, see [Picking a Router][pickingarouter]</docs-warning>

This is useful when you need to:

- fetch data not associated with UI routes (popovers, dynamic forms, etc.)
- submit data to actions without navigating (shared components like a newsletter sign ups)
- handle multiple concurrent submissions in a list (typical "todo app" list where you can click multiple buttons and all should be pending at the same time)
- infinite scroll containers
- and more!

If you're building a highly interactive, "app like" user interface, you will `useFetcher` often.

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "react-router-dom";

function SomeComponent() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  // call submit or load in a useEffect
  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetcher.submit(data, options);
    fetcher.load(href);
  }, [fetcher]);

  // build your UI with these properties
  fetcher.state;
  fetcher.formData;
  fetcher.json;
  fetcher.text;
  fetcher.formMethod;
  fetcher.formAction;
  fetcher.data;

  // render a form that doesn't cause navigation
  return <fetcher.Form />;
}
```

Fetchers have a lot of built-in behavior:

- Automatically handles cancellation on interruptions of the fetch
- When submitting with POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, the action is called first
  - After the action completes, the data on the page is revalidated to capture any mutations that may have happened, automatically keeping your UI in sync with your server state
- When multiple fetchers are inflight at once, it will
  - commit the freshest available data as they each land
  - ensure no stale loads override fresher data, no matter which order the responses return
- Handles uncaught errors by rendering the nearest `errorElement` (just like a normal navigation from `<Link>` or `<Form>`)
- Will redirect the app if your action/loader being called returns a redirect (just like a normal navigation from `<Link>` or `<Form>`)

## Options

### `key`

By default, `useFetcher` generate a unique fetcher scoped to that component (however, it may be looked up in [`useFetchers()`][use-fetchers] while in-flight). If you want to identify a fetcher with your own `key` such that you can access it from elsewhere in your app, you can do that with the `key` option:

```tsx lines=[2,8]
function AddToBagButton() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher({ key: "add-to-bag" });
  return <fetcher.Form method="post">...</fetcher.Form>;
}

// Then, up in the header...
function CartCount({ count }) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher({ key: "add-to-bag" });
  const inFlightCount = Number(
    fetcher.formData?.get("quantity") || 0
  );
  const optimisticCount = count + inFlightCount;
  return (
    <>
      <BagIcon />
      <span>{optimisticCount}</span>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Components

### `fetcher.Form`

Just like `<Form>` except it doesn't cause a navigation. <small>(You'll get over the dot in JSX ... we hope!)</small>

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post" action="/some/route">
      <input type="text" />
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

## Methods

### `fetcher.load(href, options)`

Loads data from a route loader.

```tsx lines=[8]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router-dom";

function SomeComponent() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (fetcher.state === "idle" && !fetcher.data) {
      fetcher.load("/some/route");
    }
  }, [fetcher]);

  return <div>{fetcher.data || "Loading..."}</div>;
}
```

Although a URL might match multiple nested routes, a `fetcher.load()` call will only call the loader on the leaf match (or parent of [index routes][indexsearchparam]).

If you find yourself calling this function inside of click handlers, you can probably simplify your code by using `<fetcher.Form>` instead.

<docs-info>Any `fetcher.load` calls that are active on the page will be re-executed as part of revalidation (either after a navigation submission, another fetcher submission, or a `useRevalidator()` call)</docs-info>

#### `options.unstable_flushSync`

The `unstable_flushSync` option tells React Router DOM to wrap the initial state update for this `fetcher.load` in a [`ReactDOM.flushSync`][flush-sync] call instead of the default [`React.startTransition`][start-transition]. This allows you to perform synchronous DOM actions immediately after the update is flushed to the DOM.

<docs-warning>Please note that this API is marked unstable and may be subject to breaking changes without a major release</docs-warning>

### `fetcher.submit()`

The imperative version of `<fetcher.Form>`. If a user interaction should initiate the fetch, you should use `<fetcher.Form>`. But if you, the programmer are initiating the fetch (not in response to a user clicking a button, etc.), then use this function.

For example, you may want to log the user out after a certain amount of idle time:

```tsx lines=[1,5,10-13]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router-dom";
import { useFakeUserIsIdle } from "./fake/hooks";

export function useIdleLogout() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  const userIsIdle = useFakeUserIsIdle();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (userIsIdle) {
      fetcher.submit(
        { idle: true },
        { method: "post", action: "/logout" }
      );
    }
  }, [userIsIdle]);
}
```

`fetcher.submit` is a wrapper around a [`useSubmit`][use-submit] call for the fetcher instance, so it also accepts the same options as `useSubmit`.

If you want to submit to an index route, use the [`?index` param][indexsearchparam].

If you find yourself calling this function inside of click handlers, you can probably simplify your code by using `<fetcher.Form>` instead.

## Properties

### `fetcher.state`

You can know the state of the fetcher with `fetcher.state`. It will be one of:

- **idle** - nothing is being fetched.
- **submitting** - A route action is being called due to a fetcher submission using POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE
- **loading** - The fetcher is calling a loader (from a `fetcher.load`) or is being revalidated after a separate submission or `useRevalidator` call

### `fetcher.data`

The returned data from the loader or action is stored here. Once the data is set, it persists on the fetcher even through reloads and resubmissions.

```tsx
function ProductDetails({ product }) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  return (
    <details
      onToggle={(event) => {
        if (
          event.currentTarget.open &&
          fetcher.state === "idle" &&
          !fetcher.data
        ) {
          fetcher.load(`/product/${product.id}/details`);
        }
      }}
    >
      <summary>{product.name}</summary>
      {fetcher.data ? (
        <div>{fetcher.data}</div>
      ) : (
        <div>Loading product details...</div>
      )}
    </details>
  );
}
```

### `fetcher.formData`

When using `<fetcher.Form>` or `fetcher.submit()`, the form data is available to build optimistic UI.

```tsx
function TaskCheckbox({ task }) {
  let fetcher = useFetcher();

  // while data is in flight, use that to immediately render
  // the state you expect the task to be in when the form
  // submission completes, instead of waiting for the
  // network to respond. When the network responds, the
  // formData will no longer be available and the UI will
  // use the value in `task.status` from the revalidation
  let status =
    fetcher.formData?.get("status") || task.status;

  let isComplete = status === "complete";

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post">
      <button
        type="submit"
        name="status"
        value={isComplete ? "complete" : "incomplete"}
      >
        {isComplete ? "Mark Complete" : "Mark Incomplete"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

### `fetcher.json`

When using `fetcher.submit(data, { formEncType: "application/json" })`, the submitted JSON is available via `fetcher.json`.

### `fetcher.text`

When using `fetcher.submit(data, { formEncType: "text/plain" })`, the submitted text is available via `fetcher.text`.

### `fetcher.formAction`

Tells you the action url the form is being submitted to.

```tsx
<fetcher.Form action="/mark-as-read" />;

// when the form is submitting
fetcher.formAction; // "mark-as-read"
```

### `fetcher.formMethod`

Tells you the method of the form being submitted: get, post, put, patch, or delete.

```tsx
<fetcher.Form method="post" />;

// when the form is submitting
fetcher.formMethod; // "post"
```

<docs-warning>The `fetcher.formMethod` field is lowercase without the `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod` [Future Flag][api-development-strategy]. This is being normalized to uppercase to align with the `fetch()` behavior in v7, so please upgrade your React Router v6 applications to adopt the uppercase HTTP methods.</docs-warning>

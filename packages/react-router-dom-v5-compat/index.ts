/**
 * Welcome future Michael and Ryan ðŸ‘‹, or anybody else reading this. We're doing
 * weird stuff here to help folks to migrate their React Router v5 apps to v6.
 *
 * So WTFlip is going on here?
 *
 * - We need to be able to run react-router-dom@v5 in parallel with
 *   react-router-dom@v6
 *
 * - npm/node/whoever doesn't let an app depend on two versions of the same
 *   package
 *
 * - Not only do we need to run two versions of the same package, we also need
 *   this `CompatRouter` to *itself* depend on both versions ðŸ˜¬
 *
 * - When this package depends on "history" and "react-router-dom", those need
 *   to be the `peerDependencies` that the application package.json declares.
 *
 * - That means this package can't depend on "react-router-dom" v6, but it needs to,
 *   therefore it must ~become~ react-router-dom v6 ðŸ‘»
 *
 * - We could import from "../../react-router-dom" and get rollup to bundle it as part
 *   of this package instead BUT ...
 *
 * - TSC needs to generate the types, and it has to derive the output paths from
 *   the import paths. If we have a weird require *outside of this package* to
 *   "../../react-router-dom" it's going to generate types from the common root
 *   of all module paths (Which makes sense because what else would it do? It
 *   needs to write the type files next to the source files so that typescript
 *   can resolve the types for tooling in the same location as the modules).
 *   Because tsc isn't as flexible as rollup, we have no control over this
 *   behavior.
 *
 * - Therefore, we simply copy the v6 modules into this package at build time.
 *   TSC won't come across any weird require paths (requiring outside of this
 *   package with "../../") and everybody puts the files where everybody else
 *   expects them to be.
 *
 * - The v6 `StaticRouter` found in `react-router-dom/server.ts` has a funny
 *   require to *itself* ("react-router-dom") so we had to duplicate it in this
 *   package because "react-router-dom" will point to the app's v5 version. We
 *   can't change that require to a normal internal require ("../index") because
 *   we generate two bundles (one for "react-router-dom" and one for
 *   "react-router-dom/server"). If it were an internal require then SSR router
 *   apps would have two copies of "react-router-dom", two contexts, and stuff
 *   would break. We could stop doing two bundles in v6 "react-router-dom" and
 *   deprecate the deep require if we wanted to avoid the duplication here.
